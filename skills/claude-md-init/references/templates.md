# CLAUDE.md Templates

Pick the template that matches the project type/stack. All templates inherit the global rules from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (git workflow, link formatting), so the per-repo file only adds **project identity**, **canonical commands**, and **non-obvious gotchas**.

Aim for 50–120 lines total.

## Workflow-rule reference (every template)

When the project ships with `.claude/rules/git-workflow.md` (which `/project-scaffold` Step 10 writes by default), include this line near the top of the CLAUDE.md, right under the project description:

```markdown
@.claude/rules/git-workflow.md
```

The `@<path>` directive tells Claude sessions to load the referenced file as additional context, so the per-repo workflow rules apply automatically without depending on the user's global agent memory. Skip this line when retrofitting a CLAUDE.md into a repo that doesn't already have the workflow rule file.

## Conventions every template should include

Add these to each template's `## Conventions` block (in addition to the stack-specific lines already shown below). They're cross-cutting and caused real breakage on past scaffolds:

- **Don't write `BREAKING CHANGE:` or `feat!:` in commit-body prose unless you mean them.** Conventional-commits / release-please parsers match these patterns liberally and will inject a bogus `⚠ BREAKING CHANGES` section into the CHANGELOG. Paraphrase when referring to them ("the breaking-change footer", "the bang-suffix on `feat`").
- **Env-reading modules must be lazy — throw on first *use*, not at module eval.** A db client / storage client / SDK initializer that throws at import time when an env var is unset will crash `next build` (and any type-check or page-data-collection step that imports it) in CI, where those env vars typically aren't set. Read the env var inside the function/route that needs it, or rely on lazy clients (e.g. `pg.Pool` doesn't connect until the first query). Applies to db clients, storage clients, and third-party SDKs (Stripe, Sentry, etc.).

For frontend/Next.js templates, also include the **styling convention** matching the choice made at scaffold time (CSS Modules is the default — see `project-scaffold/references/configs/styling-css-modules.md`).

## Universal preamble (always include)

```markdown
# <PROJECT_NAME>

<One-line description of what this repo is and what stack.>

@.claude/rules/git-workflow.md

## Lifecycle

- Feature branches off `develop`, never `main`.
- PRs target `develop`. CI must pass before merge.
- Release: PR `develop` → `main` (or `develop` → `stage` → `main` if staging is enabled). release-please opens a release PR with version bump + changelog. Merging the release PR tags the commit and triggers deploy.
- See `.github/workflows/` for the full pipeline.

## Project map

<2–6 bullets describing top-level directories.>

## Canonical commands

Run from the repo root:

- `npm run check:all` — runs everything CI would run (lint + typecheck + tests)
- `npm run lint` / `npm run format` / `npm run test` / `npm run build` — individual steps
- `npm run dev` — start dev server(s)
- `pre-commit run --all-files` — manually run all pre-commit hooks
```

(Python-only projects: replace `npm run` with `python scripts/dev.py`.)

---

## Frontend / Fullstack-collapsed (Next.js)

```markdown
# <PROJECT_NAME>

<One-liner: e.g., "Trading dashboard. Next.js 15 + TypeScript.">

@.claude/rules/git-workflow.md

## Lifecycle

- Feature branches off `develop`, never `main`.
- Pre-commit runs ESLint + Prettier on staged files. Don't bypass with `--no-verify`.
- PRs target `develop`. CI runs the full check suite (lint+typecheck, format:check, unit, e2e, build — plus integration if opted in).
- Releases: merge `develop` → `main` → release-please PR → tag → deploy.

## Project map

- `src/app/` — Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `src/components/` — React components
- `src/lib/` — utilities, API clients, shared logic
- `src/app/api/` — backend API routes (this is the "backend")
- `public/` — static assets

## Canonical commands

- `npm run dev` — dev server (frontend + API routes together)
- `npm run check:all` — full CI suite locally
- `npm run lint` / `npm run typecheck` / `npm run test` / `npm run build`
- `npm run test:e2e` — Playwright end-to-end tests

## Conventions

- TypeScript strict mode is on. Don't disable it.
- Imports: type imports first (sorted), then value imports (sorted). Prettier handles this automatically.
- Imports use the `@/` alias for `src/`.
- **Styling: CSS Modules.** Co-locate a `*.module.css` per component; reference `className={styles.x}`. No inline `style={{...}}` (beyond truly dynamic values), no Tailwind utility classes. (Replace this line with the chosen styling approach if not CSS Modules.)
- **Env-reading modules are lazy** — throw on first use, not at module eval, or `next build` crashes in CI where env vars are unset.
- **Don't write `BREAKING CHANGE:` / `feat!:` in commit-body prose** unless you mean them — parsers will corrupt the CHANGELOG. Paraphrase instead.
- Conventional commits required (release-please drives off them).
```

## Backend — Python (FastAPI)

```markdown
# <PROJECT_NAME>

<One-liner: e.g., "Charting API. FastAPI + pandas. Python 3.12.">

@.claude/rules/git-workflow.md

## Lifecycle

- Feature branches off `develop`, never `main`.
- Pre-commit runs ruff (lint + format) and mypy on staged files.
- PRs target `develop`. CI runs the full check suite.
- Releases via release-please.

## Project map

- `<package_name>/` — main package
- `<package_name>/main.py` — FastAPI app entry
- `tests/` — pytest test suite
- `scripts/` — one-off CLI entry points

## Canonical commands

- `uvicorn <package_name>.main:app --reload` — dev server (interactive docs at http://localhost:8000/docs)
- `python scripts/dev.py check:all` — full CI suite locally
- `python scripts/dev.py lint` / `format` / `test` / `typecheck`

## Conventions

- Python 3.12+ required.
- Async-first — handlers should be `async def` unless you have a reason otherwise.
- Conventional commits required.
```

---

## Backend — Node (Fastify, separate from Next.js)

Use this only when the user explicitly opted out of the Next.js-only fullstack default. Otherwise the Next.js template above covers backend.

```markdown
# <PROJECT_NAME>

<One-liner: e.g., "Order execution service. Fastify + TypeScript.">

@.claude/rules/git-workflow.md

## Lifecycle

- Feature branches off `develop`, never `main`.
- Pre-commit runs ESLint + Prettier on staged files.
- PRs target `develop`. CI runs the full check suite.
- Releases via release-please.

## Project map

- `src/` — application code
- `src/routes/` — Fastify route handlers
- `src/services/` — business logic
- `src/db/` — data access layer

## Canonical commands

- `npm run dev` — dev server with hot reload
- `npm run check:all` — full CI suite locally
- `npm run lint` / `npm run typecheck` / `npm run test` / `npm run build`
- `npm start` — production server

## Environment

- Required env vars are documented in `.env.example`. Copy to `.env` for local dev.

## Conventions

- Conventional commits required.
- TypeScript strict mode is on.
- Imports: type imports first (sorted), then value imports (sorted).
```

## Fullstack — Next.js + FastAPI (two independent projects)

```markdown
# <PROJECT_NAME>

<One-liner: e.g., "Trading dashboard. Next.js frontend + FastAPI Python backend.">

@.claude/rules/git-workflow.md

## Lifecycle

- Feature branches off `develop`. PRs target `develop`. CI runs the full check suite across both sides.
- Pre-commit at repo root runs the right hooks based on which files you've staged (Python files → ruff + mypy; TS files → ESLint + Prettier).
- Releases via release-please.

## Project map

- `frontend/` — Next.js + TypeScript
- `backend/` — Python FastAPI app
- `.github/workflows/` — CI + release-please + deploy
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` — single root config covering both stacks

## Canonical commands (run from repo root)

- `npm run dev` — starts both frontend and backend dev servers
- `npm run check:all` — full CI suite locally (lint + typecheck + tests, both stacks)
- `npm run lint` / `format` / `test` / `typecheck` / `build` — runs against both stacks
- `npm run lint:frontend` / `lint:backend` (and same for other commands) — single side

## Conventions

- Frontend talks to backend via `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` env var.
- API routes are versioned (`/api/v1/...`).
- Conventional commits required.
```

---

## Fullstack — Next.js + Fastify (npm workspaces)

```markdown
# <PROJECT_NAME>

<One-liner: e.g., "Trading platform. Next.js frontend + Fastify backend, npm workspaces.">

@.claude/rules/git-workflow.md

## Lifecycle

- Feature branches off `develop`. PRs target `develop`. CI runs the full check suite.
- Pre-commit at repo root.
- Releases via release-please.

## Project map

- `frontend/` — Next.js + TypeScript
- `backend/` — Fastify + TypeScript
- `shared/` — shared types between backend and frontend (if needed)
- Root `package.json` defines workspaces and orchestrates cross-stack scripts

## Canonical commands (run from repo root)

- `npm install` — installs everything across workspaces
- `npm run dev` — starts both
- `npm run check:all` — full CI suite locally
- `npm run lint` / `format` / `test` / `typecheck` / `build`

## Conventions

- Shared types live in `shared/` and are imported via `@<project>/shared`.
- Conventional commits required.
- TypeScript strict mode in both workspaces.
```

---

## Library

Use the matching backend template above as a starting point and:
- Replace "service" / "app" language with "library" / "package"
- Add a "Publishing" section — release-please handles tagging; publish step lives in `deploy.yml`
- Drop the "Environment" section if not relevant

---

## Research / notebooks

```markdown
# <PROJECT_NAME>

<One-liner: e.g., "Exploratory backtest research for MNQ breakout strategies.">

@.claude/rules/git-workflow.md

## Lifecycle

- Feature branches off `develop` for non-trivial work. Trivial notebook tweaks can go on `develop` directly.
- Pre-commit runs ruff on `.py` files (notebooks excluded).
- CI is lighter for research projects — lint + smoke-test notebooks.

## Project map

- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks, dated and named by topic
- `data/` — input data (gitignored if large)
- `outputs/` — generated charts, reports (gitignored)
- `lib/` — reusable Python helpers

## Canonical commands

- `jupyter lab` — launch notebook server
- `python scripts/dev.py lint` — lint helper modules
- `pre-commit run --all-files` — manual full-repo lint

## Conventions

- Notebooks are named `YYYY-MM-DD_topic.ipynb`.
- Heavy data and generated outputs are gitignored.
```

---

## What NOT to put in any of these templates

- Linter/formatter rules (the configs themselves enforce them)
- Style rules inferable from existing code
- Hotfix-style instructions
- Path-scoped rules (move to `.claude/rules/<name>.md`)
- Workflow procedures (move to `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`)
- Anything already in the README or `package.json` / `pyproject.toml`
