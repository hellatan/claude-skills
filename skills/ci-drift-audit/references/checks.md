# Drift checks

Each check: what it looks for, why it matters, how to detect it, and what fixes it. Add
new checks in this format — a check without a documented *why* becomes noise nobody can
triage.

Severity drives alerting: **high** and **medium** are worth waking someone; **low** is
worth a line in the report; **informational** must never fail a run.

---

## 0. Locating the CI workflow — precondition for checks 1–4

Checks 1 through 4 all read "the CI workflow." Finding it by filename is the most
expensive mistake this audit can make, because a miss doesn't produce one wrong line —
it **ends the audit of that repo**, and every check that would have run against the file
goes unreported as a side effect.

**Detect — by behaviour, not filename.** The defining behaviour of a CI gate is that it
runs on `pull_request`. That one property excludes release, promotion, backmerge, deploy
and `/rebuild` workflows without needing a list of their names. Where several workflows
qualify, prefer ones named like CI (`validate*`, `test*`, `check*`, `verify*`, `build*`,
`lint*`) so the file you report is the one a human would point at.

Only after identifying it that way, judge the name. Anything other than
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` is **present-but-drifted** — report it as a rename, the way
checks 5 and 6 handle theirs, and **still run checks 1–4 against it**.

> ⚠️ **Not hypothetical.** An audit matching the literal filename `ci.yml` reported two
> repos as having "no baseline CI" when both ran a complete gate from `validate.yml`.
> Because "no CI" terminated their audit at that line, a `push:` trigger including
> `develop` — the highest-severity check here — sat unreported in one of them for the
> entire life of the check. The audit was silent about its own blind spot, which is the
> failure mode every check in this file is written to avoid.

Genuinely missing (no workflow anywhere runs on `pull_request`) stays **high**: the repo
has no gate at all.

---

## 1. `push:` must not include `develop` — high

**Why.** Every commit reaches `develop` through a PR, which already ran the full suite
via the `pull_request` trigger. Re-running CI on the post-merge push to `develop`
re-tests code that just passed — pure duplicate billed minutes, and historically the
single biggest waste in these repos. `push: main` is deliberately kept as a cheap
re-check on the develop→main landing before a release; long-lived integration branches
may also appear.

**Detect.**

```bash
yq '.on.push | has("branches")' ci.yml        # false => fires on EVERY branch => drift
yq '.on.push.branches[]' ci.yml               # `develop` present => drift
```

Beware `on` parsing: YAML 1.1 readers coerce a bare `on:` key to boolean `true`. In
Python, `yaml.safe_load(...)[True]`. `yq` handles `.on` correctly; if using another
parser, verify against a known file first.

> ⚠️ **`// []` is the wrong default here.** A bare `push:` with no `branches:` filter
> fires on *every* branch — develop included, plus every WIP feature branch. Collapsing
> "no filter" to an empty list makes that read as "develop absent", so the worst case
> passes silently. Ask whether the filter *exists* before asking what's in it.

**Fix.** Remove `develop` from `on.push.branches`, keeping `main` and any
`integration/**`. See `gh-actions-init/references/ci-cost-migration.md` — non-breaking,
renames nothing.

**Legitimate exception.** A repo with no PR flow (direct pushes to `develop`) genuinely
needs the push trigger. Record such repos as exceptions in the host's repo list rather
than muting the check globally.

---

## 2. `pull_request:` covers branches that receive PRs — high

**Why.** The mirror of check 1, pointing the opposite way. If `develop` is missing from
`pull_request.branches`, PRs into `develop` run **no CI at all** — a hole in the gate,
not a cost saving. Worth flagging louder than a wasted minute.

**Detect.**

```bash
yq '.on | has("pull_request")' ci.yml              # false => no gate at all => drift
yq '.on.pull_request | has("branches")' ci.yml     # false => covers every branch => PASS
yq '.on.pull_request.branches[]' ci.yml            # only then: expect main + develop
```

> ⚠️ **The same `// []` trap, pointing the other way.** A bare `pull_request:` covers
> every branch, so it is the *most* complete gate there is. Defaulting it to an empty
> list reports it as "missing main, missing develop — PRs into it run no CI" about repos
> whose PRs all run CI. That fired on two repos in one run, and false positives at
> **high** severity are how an alert channel gets muted.
>
> The asymmetry is the point: for `push:` an absent filter is worse than a broad one, for
> `pull_request:` it is better. Same YAML shape, opposite verdicts — which is why the
> existence of the filter has to be a separate fact from its contents.

**Fix.** Add the missing branch(es). See `gh-actions-init/references/ci-structure.md`.

---

## 3. Playwright e2e job caches browsers — medium

**Why.** A bare `npx playwright install --with-deps` re-downloads ~100MB+ of browser
binaries on every run: 1–2 min of billed time a cache hit removes.

**Detect.** Only applies if a Playwright job exists (`playwright install` appears). Then
require an `actions/cache` step with `path: ~/.cache/ms-playwright`. Drift =
`playwright install` present **and** no such cache step.

**Fix.** `testing-init/references/ci-test-job.md` has the cache block, including the
conditional install pair (`install-deps` on hit, `install --with-deps` on miss).

**False-positive guard.** A repo may cache via a different mechanism or a custom action.
Match on the cache *path*, not the exact step name.

---

## 4. `workflow_dispatch:` present on the CI workflow — low

**Why.** Without it there's no way to re-run CI except pushing a commit, which costs a
whole fresh run. It's also the dispatch target `/rebuild` falls back to when a branch has
no prior run.

**Detect.**

```bash
yq '.on | has("workflow_dispatch")' ci.yml
```

**Fix.** Add `workflow_dispatch:` to `on:`. See
`gh-actions-init/references/ci-structure.md`.

---

## 5. `/rebuild` workflow present — low

**Why.** ChatOps re-trigger for flaky runs and the bot-PR CI gap. Cheaper than the
alternative (an empty commit = a whole fresh run).

**Detect — by behaviour, not filename.** Scan every file in `.github/workflows/` for one
triggered `on: issue_comment` that gates on `/rebuild`. Then check whether it sits at the
canonical `.github/workflows/rebuild.yml`; any other name (the known legacy one is
`ci-rebuild-on-comment.yml`) is **present-but-drifted** — report it as a rename
(→ `rebuild.yml`, workflow `name: rebuild`), not as a missing workflow. Matching on the
filename alone reports a renamed-but-present workflow as absent, and a drifted one as
clean — see the warning under check 6 for how that played out in practice.

**Scope.** Default-on for **gitflow repos** (those with a `develop` branch) — skip for
`main`-only repos, which have no bot-PR gap. Don't report its absence as drift there.

**Also worth checking** once present: the file must live on the **default branch** to be
active at all (`issue_comment` workflows only run from the default branch), and the CI
workflow it dispatches must have `workflow_dispatch:` (check 4).

**Fix.** `gh-actions-init/references/rebuild.md`.

---

## 6. `develop → main` promotion workflow — low (missing no-squash warning: medium)

**Why.** Nothing else opens the release PR, so without it every release waits on someone
remembering to open one by hand. Its generated body also carries the no-squash warning,
which is the only thing between a routine merge and permanent branch divergence.

**Detect — by behaviour, never by filename.** Scan *every* file in
`.github/workflows/` for one that runs `gh pr create` with both `--base main` and
`--head develop`. That workflow is the promotion workflow whatever it happens to be
called. Only after identifying it that way, check whether it sits at the canonical path
`.github/workflows/develop-to-main-pr.yml`.

> ⚠️ **Filename matching is how this check fails.** A fleet-wide sweep that grepped for
> `develop-to-main*` silently skipped the one repo whose promotion workflow was named
> `auto-promote.yml`. That repo was the only one left without the no-squash warning, and
> a filename-scoped audit reported it as clean. At least three names have existed in the
> wild (`develop-to-main-pr.yml`, `develop-to-main.yml`, `auto-promote.yml`), so treat the
> name as unknown and match on what the workflow *does*.

Three drift shapes, all **present-but-drifted** rather than missing:

- **Non-canonical filename** — anything that isn't `develop-to-main-pr.yml`. Report as a
  rename (→ `develop-to-main-pr.yml`, workflow `name: develop → main PR`), the same way
  check 5 handles the old `/rebuild` name.
- **Body missing the no-squash warning** — the generated body must lead with
  `## ⚠️ Merge with "Create a merge commit" — NOT squash`. Grep the workflow for
  `NOT squash`. Report this even when the filename is correct; a repo scaffolded before
  the warning existed passes a presence-only check while still carrying the risk.
- **Opens but never refreshes** — older generations `exit 0` when a PR is already open, so
  the body goes stale as soon as `develop` advances, and a stale PR is never closed once
  `develop` falls level with `main`. Detect: no `gh pr edit` call, or no close step.

**Why that warning is load-bearing.** Squash-merging the promotion PR collapses `develop`'s
commits into one *new* commit on `main`, so git stops seeing them as merged. Every later
promotion PR then opens against a stale merge base and reads as permanently "behind", and
the gap compounds each release. This is real divergence — distinct from the harmless
cosmetic behind-ness caused by the merge commit itself, which `develop-to-main-pr.md`
explains.

**Scope.** Gitflow repos without a `stage` branch. Skip `main`-only repos, and skip repos
with a staging topology (`develop → stage → main` needs a different two-workflow setup).

**Fix.** `gh-actions-init/references/develop-to-main-pr.md`.

---

## 7. Job consolidation (`checks`) — informational only

**Why informational.** Merging the light jobs into one `checks` job saves real minutes
(one `npm ci` + checkout instead of several, less per-job rounding), but it **renames the
status checks**. On any repo with required status checks — public repos, or private on a
paid plan — renaming without updating the required-check list makes PRs hang forever on
checks that never report. That makes it an opt-in migration, not a baseline everyone must
match.

**Report** which shape each repo is in (separate jobs vs consolidated) so the fleet's
state is visible. **Never fail** on it.

**Before consolidating any repo**, check whether required checks exist:

```bash
gh api "repos/$REPO/branches/$BRANCH/protection/required_status_checks" --jq '.contexts' \
  2>/dev/null || echo "none (404) or unavailable (403 — free-tier private)"
```

`gitflow-init` owns branch protection; it derives required contexts from the workflow's
job names rather than hardcoding them, so a *fresh* scaffold adapts automatically. The
breakage is in repos whose protection was applied with the older names.

---

## 8. Release-tag verification present and correctly wired — low missing / **high** miswired

**Why.** release-please can merge a release PR, report the run **success**, and create no
tag. Nothing else notices: the merged release PR stays `autorelease: pending`, which makes
every later run abort with `There are untagged, merged release PRs outstanding` — silently,
still green. Releases just stop, and the repo looks healthy the whole time. The `verify-tag`
steps are the only thing that turns that into a failed run and an alert.

**Scope.** Repos that use release-please. Detect that by behaviour, not by filename: scan
every file in `.github/workflows/` for one that `uses: googleapis/release-please-action`.
The config is **not** reliably at `.github/release-please-config.json` either — at least one
repo keeps it at the repo root — so read the `config-file` / `manifest-file` inputs off that
workflow rather than assuming a path. Skip repos with no release-please workflow.

**Two drift shapes, deliberately different severities.**

- **Missing entirely — low.** The release job has no verification steps. Detect: no step in
  that workflow looks up a tag ref (`git/ref/tags`). This is "not rolled out yet," not a
  malfunction, and it will be true of most repos until the rollout finishes — so it must
  stay quiet enough that nobody learns to skim the report. Report it, don't shout.
- **Present but reading the wrong outputs — high.** The block gates on
  `steps.release.outputs.release_created` or `steps.release.outputs.tag_name`. Detect: match
  those keys **only inside a `${{ … }}` expression** —
  `grep -E '\$\{\{[^}]*outputs\.(release_created|tag_name)'`. A bare
  `grep outputs.release_created` reports the **fixed** shape as broken, because the correct
  block carries a comment naming those keys to warn the next reader off them. Verified: that
  naive grep flags the one repo already on the corrected version. Those keys
  only exist when the manifest package sits at the repo **root** — `setPathOutput()` in
  release-please-action namespaces every per-package output as `<path>--<key>` for any other
  path. Cross-check the package path: read the `packages` keys from the config the workflow
  actually points at.
  - **package path ≠ `.`** → **high**. Both keys are permanently empty, so the check alerts
    "release PR merged but NO TAG created" on every healthy release *and* its
    "tag missing" branch is unreachable dead code. The repo is actively lying in both
    directions. Observed live: a 0.26.0 release alerted as a silent freeze seconds after
    its tag was published by the same run.
  - **package path = `.`** → medium. It works today and breaks the moment the package moves
    or a second one is added, which is a one-line fix now and a mystery later.

A correctly wired block reads the tags out of `toJSON(steps.release.outputs)` (selecting
keys that end in `tag_name`) and verifies each against the tag ref on the remote. That form
is config-independent — root, non-root, and per-component monorepo tags all resolve — so
treat its presence as the pass condition.

**Also worth reporting, both low.** The alert is optional plumbing, and its absence is
quiet by design, which is exactly why it needs surfacing:

- `.github/actions/discord-alert/action.yml` missing while the workflow references it — the
  run fails on a missing action rather than alerting.
- The webhook secret named in the workflow not present in `gh secret list`. The composite
  no-ops with a `::warning::` when unset, so the whole alerting path is dead and every run
  still looks green. Read the secret name out of the workflow rather than assuming it —
  the channel is a per-project choice, and repos deliberately use different ones.

> ⚠️ **"Wired" and "the secret exists" are two different checks.** This exact conflation
> has already burned a fleet audit once, on `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN`: the workflow referenced
> the secret correctly, the audit called it clean, and the secret had never been created.
> An unset secret interpolates to an empty string. Check both.

**Fix.** `gh-actions-init/references/release-verification.md`.

---

## 9. Tagged-only deploy can actually fire, and only when it should — **high** scoped package / **high** unguarded auto-merge / medium changelog gaps

**Why.** Under the tagged-only deploy model, the tag *is* the deploy trigger: nothing ships
except a commit release-please tagged. That makes "release-please declined to cut a
release" and "production is a version behind" the same event — and neither one fails
anything. There is no red run, no failed deploy, no alert; the release workflow reports
success because from its own point of view nothing was wrong. Live code sits on the
release branch, dead in production, indefinitely. Every drift shape below is a way for
that to happen quietly, which is why they're worth an audit rather than a runbook.

**Scope.** Repos that use release-please **and** deploy. Detect release-please the same
way check 8 does (by behaviour, and read the `config-file` / `manifest-file` inputs off
that workflow — the config is not reliably at `.github/release-please-config.json`).
Detect "deploys" by a deploy step in the release job (a deploy-hook `curl`, a platform
CLI invocation) or a separate deploy workflow. Skip repos with neither.

**Skip repos that deliberately don't deploy yet.** The scaffolded opt-out is a repo
variable (`RENDER_DEPLOY=false` in the default template), and a fresh scaffold starts
there on purpose. Read it before reporting:

```bash
gh api "repos/$REPO/actions/variables/RENDER_DEPLOY" --jq '.value' 2>/dev/null
```

`false` → the deploy step is dormant by design; report nothing. Anything else, including
a 404, means this repo deploys.

**Four drift shapes.**

- **Auto-merge doesn't wait for the release PR's checks — high.** Merging the release PR is
  what cuts the tag, and under this model the tag *is* the deploy. So an auto-merge step
  that merges the moment the PR exists deploys code whose CI hasn't reported — or has
  reported red. It looks completely healthy: the release tags, the deploy fires, and the
  checks usually happen to pass. Detect by reading the auto-merge step's script:

  ```bash
  yq '.jobs.*.steps[] | select(.run // "" | test("gh pr merge")) | .run' <release workflow>
  ```

  Drift = a `gh pr merge` with no wait in front of it. Two shapes count as waiting: a poll
  loop over the PR's `statusCheckRollup` / `gh pr checks --watch`, or `gh pr merge --auto`
  **backed by required status checks that actually exist**.

  **`--auto` alone is not a pass — verify both preconditions**, because it silently
  degrades to an instant merge:

  ```bash
  gh api "repos/$REPO" --jq '.allow_auto_merge'                        # false => --auto errors
  gh api "repos/$REPO/branches/<release-branch>/protection" --jq '.required_status_checks.contexts'
  ```

  `allow_auto_merge: false`, or a 403 on the protection endpoint (free-plan private repo —
  branch protection unavailable), means `--auto` has nothing to wait on. **Do not report
  "enable branch protection" as the fix on those repos** — it can't be enabled without
  making the repo public or paying for Pro. The fix is an in-step poll.

  **Also check the refusal path.** A gate that merges anyway on a red or check-less PR is
  no gate. Expect: failure / no-checks-registered / timeout all leave the PR **open** and
  alert. An open release PR is *not* what `release-health.yml`'s sweep flags (that's a
  **merged** PR still labelled `autorelease: pending`), so without its own alert a release
  that stops there is invisible — report a missing alert as part of this finding.

  **Not drift:** repos where auto-merge is off entirely (a human merges the release PR) —
  the human is the gate. Check the `RELEASE_AUTOMERGE` variable.

  **A gate that can't read is as broken as no gate — check the token and the permissions.**
  A poll that reads check state with the *release PAT* fails on every iteration
  (`Resource not accessible by personal access token`) because a fine-grained PAT scoped
  for release-please has no `Checks: read`. The release then stalls for the whole timeout,
  alerts, and leaves its PR open — every time. This shipped and hit production, and it is
  invisible to a reviewer reading only the polling logic, which is correct. Two reads:

  ```bash
  # 1. does the poll read with the PAT? (drift)
  yq '.jobs.*.steps[] | select(.run // "" | test("gh pr merge")) | .env' <release workflow>
  # 2. can the built-in token see checks at all?
  yq '.permissions' <release workflow>
  ```

  Drift = the step's read calls run under `secrets.*` rather than `github.token`, **or** a
  declared `permissions:` block without `checks: read` (and `statuses: read`). The second
  is easy to miss: declaring a block sets every unlisted scope to `none`, so adding the
  check gate without widening permissions breaks it just as thoroughly. The fix is to read
  with `github.token` and scope the PAT to the `gh pr merge` call alone — **not** to widen
  the PAT, which would have to be redone per repo and per token rotation.

- **release-please scoped to a subdirectory — high** (when the repo has code outside that
  path). release-please only counts commits touching files **under** a package's path, so
  a change confined to an internal workspace package or to root-level tooling cuts no
  release, never tags, and therefore never deploys. Detect by reading the `packages` keys
  from the config the workflow actually points at — expect exactly `["."]`:

  ```bash
  jq -r '.packages | keys[]' "$CONFIG"     # anything but "." => drift
  ```

  Check 8 already resolves that config path and reads the same keys for a different
  purpose (whether `release_created` / `tag_name` are namespaced). One read, two findings
  — don't re-derive it here. The distinction: check 8 is about the *verification block
  lying*; this one is about *releases never being cut in the first place*.

  **Downgrade to medium** when the scoped path is genuinely the whole repo (a single-app
  repo with nothing outside `apps/web`, no root tooling that ships). It works today and
  breaks the first time a shared package appears.

  **Legitimate exception:** a true multi-deploy monorepo with per-component tags
  (`include-component-in-tag: true`) is a different, deliberate design — root-scoping
  would be wrong there. Record those as exceptions rather than muting the check.

- **`changelog-sections` missing, or not un-hiding every commit type — medium.**
  release-please **skips a release entirely when the generated changelog would be empty**,
  and `chore` / `docs` / `ci` / `style` / `test` / `build` are hidden by default. So a
  docs-only or CI-only promotion cuts no tag and never deploys — the release branch drifts
  ahead of production by exactly the changes nobody thought were risky. Absent
  `changelog-sections` is the same finding as a partial one: the defaults hide those types.

  ```bash
  jq -r '.["changelog-sections"] // "MISSING"' "$CONFIG"
  jq -r '.["changelog-sections"] // [] | .[] | select(.hidden == true) | .type' "$CONFIG"
  ```

  Drift = `MISSING`, or any type still `hidden: true`. `changelog-sections` may sit at the
  top level **or** inside a package entry — check both before reporting it absent.

  **Do not report `always-bump-patch` as the fix.** It flattens `feat` → patch and breaks
  semantic versioning; un-hiding the sections is the correct change.

- **Deploy still a separate workflow on `on: push: tags` — high.** GitHub's recursion guard
  suppresses workflow triggers for any ref pushed with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so a
  tag release-please cut with that token never fires the deploy workflow. It looks correct,
  passes review, and simply never runs.

  ```bash
  yq '.on.push.tags // "none"' <each workflow>          # non-null => tag-triggered
  yq '.jobs.*.steps[] | select(.uses | test("release-please-action")) | .with.token' \
     <release workflow>                                  # empty/github.token => GITHUB_TOKEN
  ```

  Drift = a tag-triggered deploy workflow **and** a release-please step with no PAT
  `token:`. Two valid fixes, and the report should name both: fold the deploy into the job
  that cuts the tag (the scaffolded shape), or push the tag with a PAT, which restores the
  trigger.

  **False-positive guard.** If tags also arrive from somewhere else — a human pushing
  `vX.Y.Z` by hand, another workflow using a PAT — the trigger does fire and the workflow
  isn't dead. Flag high only when release-please is the sole tag source.

**Known blind spot: this check cannot see the platform.** Whether native git auto-deploy
is actually off lives in the hosting dashboard, not in the repo, so an audit reading
workflow files can't confirm it. A repo can pass all three shapes above and still
double-deploy — once untagged on the branch push, once from CI — because a `render.yaml`
saying `autoDeploy: false` does nothing until the Blueprint is re-synced on a
pre-existing service. Say so in the report rather than implying the deploy model is
verified end to end.

**Fix.** `gh-actions-init/references/tagged-deploy.md` — the canonical explanation of the
model and of each of these failure modes. Config in
`gh-actions-init/references/release-please.md`.

---

## What the audit declines to check

Discovery mode enumerates every repo the token can see, which on a personal account means
years of finished and abandoned work alongside the handful under active development. Those
repos cannot be accruing billed minutes and cannot be drifting — nothing is running. Every
line spent on them buries the repos that need attention, and a report where most entries
are noise gets skimmed exactly like a report of nothing.

Two conditions are therefore **skipped**, not drift:

- **Dormant** — no push in a threshold window (365 days is a reasonable default; make it
  configurable). Report the date: `skipped: dormant — last push 2015-01-07`.
- **Empty** — no commits at all. GitHub answers `409 Conflict`, not 404, on the commits
  endpoint for these.

Prefer dormancy over listing the archive in an ignore file. A threshold needs no
maintenance and re-audits a repo the moment it gets a commit; a hand-written list has to
be maintained forever and goes on silently ignoring a repo that came back to life — the
same shrinking-coverage failure this skill exists to catch.

That leaves the ignore file for **deliberate** exceptions only: repos that are active but
genuinely shouldn't have CI (source-only repos with nothing to build, config backups,
generated-artifact archives). Require a reason on every entry — an ignore without one is
indistinguishable from an oversight a year later.

Report skips, never alert on them. A skip is the audit declining to have an opinion, not
a finding.

---

## 9. Referenced secrets exist — medium (dead alerts) / **high** (failing run)

**What.** Every `secrets.NAME` a workflow references should exist on the repo. Collect the
names from `.github/workflows/*` and `.github/actions/*/action.yml`, then diff against the
repo's actual secret list.

**Why this is worth an automated check.** A referenced-but-unset secret produces **no error
at scaffold time and no error at run time** in the common case, because the alerting
composite deliberately no-ops (warn + `exit 0`) when its webhook is empty. So the repo
shows green runs and no alerts — and no alerts is also exactly what a healthy repo looks
like. There is no signal to notice. Measured on one fleet: the errors webhook was set on
**1 of 13** repos; twelve had been silently discarding every alert since scaffold, for
months, with nothing anywhere reporting it. Scaffold-time prompts help but are skippable —
this check is the part that doesn't rely on anyone remembering.

**Detection.**

```bash
# referenced (workflows + composite actions)
grep -rhoE 'secrets\.[A-Z0-9_]+' .github/workflows .github/actions 2>/dev/null \
  | sed 's/secrets\.//' | sort -u
# present
gh secret list -R "$REPO" --json name -q '.[].name' | sort -u
```

Report names in the first set and not the second.

**Exclusions — do not report these:**

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` — always injected, never a repo secret.
- Anything matched inside a `${{ secrets.X != '' }}` style guard *only*, where the workflow
  already handles absence explicitly.
- Organization- or environment-scoped secrets. `gh secret list` on a repo shows repo-level
  secrets only, so an org secret reads as missing. If the owner uses org secrets, either
  add `--app actions --org` lookups or add the name to an allowlist; **say which** in the
  report rather than emitting a known-false finding every run.

**Severity split.**

- **medium** when absence degrades silently — the alerting webhooks
  (`DISCORD_*_WEBHOOK`), where the composite no-ops by design. The pipeline works; you
  just never hear from it. This is the common, invisible case.
- **high** when absence fails the run — `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` (release-please errors with
  `Input required and not supplied: token`), or a deploy credential on a repo whose deploy
  is enabled, which fails loudly by design.

**Fix.** `gh secret set <NAME> --repo <owner>/<repo>`. Then **prove delivery** for webhook
secrets rather than trusting that it's set — the run's conclusion is `success` either way:

```bash
gh workflow run release-health.yml -R <owner>/<repo> --ref <default-branch> -f test_alert=true
gh run view <run-id> -R <owner>/<repo> --log | grep -E 'alert delivered|skipping alert'
```

**Token requirement.** Needs `Secrets: Read` on the audit PAT (names only — values are not
retrievable through the API at any permission level). The base audit token doesn't have it.
When the call 403s, report `skipped: token lacks Secrets:Read` — **never a pass.** A
missing-secret check that reports "all good" because it couldn't look is precisely the
silent-coverage-loss this skill exists to prevent.

---

## 10. Prettier must not format YAML — medium

**What.** If a repo's `format:check` runs prettier over the whole tree, its
`.prettierignore` must exclude `*.yml` / `*.yaml`.

**Why.** Prettier reflows the inline comments that carry the *reasoning* in workflow
files — the "why this token, not that one" notes that are the whole point of those
comments — for no benefit. Worse, the failure is **latent**: it only surfaces the next
time someone edits a workflow, and then it lands as a red `format:check` on a PR that has
nothing to do with formatting, which reads as "my change broke CI." Observed live: two
repos went red on `.github/workflows/release-please.yml` during an unrelated CI rollout;
both had a `.prettierignore` that simply predated the convention.

**Detection.**

```bash
# does this repo run prettier over the tree at all?
fc=$(jq -r '.scripts["format:check"] // .scripts.format // ""' package.json)
case "$fc" in
  *prettier*)
    grep -qE '^\*\.ya?ml|^\*\*/\*\.ya?ml|^\.github' .prettierignore 2>/dev/null || echo "DRIFT" ;;
esac
```

**Only flag repos that actually run prettier across the repo root.** Three shapes are
*not* drift and must not be reported:

- no `format:check` script at all,
- a scoped script (`prettier --check apps/web`, `npm run format:check:web`) that never
  reaches `.github/`,
- a non-prettier formatter (`ruff format --check .` on Python repos).

A blanket "no `.prettierignore`" check would flag every one of those. Read the script
first, then the ignore file.

**Fix.** Append to `.prettierignore` — keep the comment, it's what stops someone deleting
the lines as noise:

```
# Prettier's YAML formatting mangles hand-maintained GitHub Actions workflow
# files (reflowing inline comments) for zero benefit — skip all YAML.
*.yml
*.yaml
```

## Reporting shape

Only drifted items, grouped by repo, each naming its fix:

```
hellatan/example-app
  ✗ high    push: includes `develop` — remove it (ci-cost-migration.md)
  ✗ low     no workflow_dispatch on ci.yml
  ℹ         jobs: separate (not consolidated)

hellatan/other-app
  ⚠ skipped dormant — last push 2016-11-22

hellatan/third-app
  ⚠ skipped repo unreadable with this token
```

Keep `skipped` visually distinct from both clean and drifted, and count the three
separately in the footer. A repo the audit couldn't read is an unknown, not a pass — the
failure mode to avoid is a silently shrinking audit that keeps reporting "all green."
