# Migrating an existing CI to the deduplicated triggers

Applies to a repo already scaffolded (by an older version of this skill, or by hand)
whose `ci.yml` runs on **both** `pull_request` and `push` for `develop`. That duplicates
Actions minutes: every commit reaches `develop` through a PR that already ran the full
suite, so the post-merge `push` run on `develop` re-tests code that already passed.

This is the **non-breaking** half of the cost work — changing `on:` triggers renames
nothing, so no status-check or branch-protection changes are involved. (Job
*consolidation*, which renames checks, is a separate breaking change — see the note at
the end.)

## The change

```diff
 on:
   pull_request:
     branches: [main, develop]
   push:
-    branches: [main, develop]
+    branches: [main]            # + any long-lived integration branches; never develop
   workflow_dispatch:
```

Keep `main` in `push`: it's the cheap re-check on the develop→main landing before a
release. If the repo has long-lived integration branches (e.g. `integration/**`) that
receive direct pushes, list those too — just not `develop`.

## When this is safe (which is almost always)

The develop→main **promotion PR** is a `pull_request`, so it still runs the full suite
before anything reaches `main`. Dropping the `push`@develop run removes only the
post-merge re-test of already-green code. The one thing it gives up: on a repo *without*
"require branches up to date before merging" (which includes every free-tier private
repo, where branch protection is unavailable), a PR merged on a stale base lands a
`develop` tree that wasn't tested as a whole. The promotion PR still catches that before
`main` — you lose detection *speed*, not the gate. On a solo repo merging PRs
sequentially the window is negligible.

## Verify the saving with real numbers

Don't estimate — GitHub reports billed minutes per run. Full before/after procedure
(the `runs/{id}/timing` endpoint, baseline/after tables, the pricing constant) lives in
`getoffthecouch:docs/ci-actions-cost-measurement.md`. In short:

```bash
# billed Ubuntu ms for one run
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/runs/<RUN_ID>/timing --jq '.billable.UBUNTU.total_ms'
```

After the change, confirm **no** CI run fires on the `push` to `develop` (only the
promotion PR runs), and that the promotion PR still runs the full suite.

## Related but separate: job consolidation (breaking)

Merging the lint/typecheck/test jobs into a single `checks` job saves more minutes
(one `npm ci` + checkout instead of several, less per-job rounding) but **renames the
status checks**. That is a breaking change *for any repo that has required status
checks* — i.e. public repos or paid plans. Before doing it there, update the required
checks (remove the old names, add `checks`) or PRs hang on checks that never report.
On a free-tier private repo there are no required checks, so the rename is a no-op.

Check whether the repo actually has required checks *first*; branch protection is owned
by `gitflow-init`. That change is tracked separately from this trigger dedup.
