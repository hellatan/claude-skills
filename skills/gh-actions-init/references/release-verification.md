# release verification + failure alerting

A safety-net that fails loudly when a release *should* have been tagged but wasn't — the prerequisite for ever auto-merging release PRs, since it removes "a human happened to be watching the merge" as the only guard. Alerts post to a Discord channel.

It is also the **gate the tagged-only deploy hangs off**: the `Evaluate release outcome` step emits a `released` output that is `true` only when a tag was cut *and* confirmed on the remote, and the deploy step in `references/tagged-deploy.md` runs on nothing else. So this file isn't optional decoration — without it there is no trustworthy signal that a deploy is warranted.

Scaffold this **alongside release-please** (same condition — skip it when release-please is skipped). Three pieces:

1. `verify-tag` — steps appended to the `release-please.yml` job (see `references/release-please.md`).
2. `.github/workflows/release-health.yml` — a daily sweep + an on-demand self-test.
3. `.github/actions/discord-alert/action.yml` — a shared composite that posts the alert.

The Discord webhook secret is **optional**: the composite no-ops (with a warning) when it's unset, so scaffolding this is harmless even if the user never wires up alerting.

## Choosing the alert channel — ask, don't assume

`<ALERT_WEBHOOK_SECRET>` in the templates below is a **placeholder you fill in at scaffold time**. A Discord webhook URL points at exactly one channel, so the secret *is* the channel: which secret name a repo's workflows read is how that project picks where its alerts land.

**Name the destination channel in the test alert itself.** Substitute `<ALERT_CHANNEL_LABEL>` (a short token, e.g. `gh_errors`) and `<ALERT_CHANNEL>` (the channel as it reads in Discord, e.g. `#gh-errors`) alongside the secret name. A test that only says "alert pipe test" proves a message *arrived* but not that it arrived in the *right place* — a webhook copied from the wrong channel delivers a clean 204 and looks exactly like success. Naming the expected channel in the title and body makes a misroute obvious on sight instead of silently passing. Same for the PR-alerts arm.

Ask the user which secret to use and substitute it into all three files before writing them. Default to **`DISCORD_GH_ERRORS_WEBHOOK`** — the shared errors channel — when they have no preference; a project that wants its own channel (`DISCORD_<PROJECT>_ALERTS`, `DISCORD_DEPLOY_WEBHOOK`, …) just names a different secret. Keep the name identical across `release-please.yml` and `release-health.yml`; a mismatch means half the alerts silently no-op.

To repoint an existing repo later, either overwrite the secret's value with a different channel's webhook URL (name unchanged, nothing to edit) or rename it and update every `secrets.` reference in `.github/workflows/`.

## Choosing the sweep schedule — stagger it

`<CRON_MINUTE>` in the `release-health.yml` template is the second scaffold-time placeholder: pick an **arbitrary minute (1–59, never 0)** per repo. GitHub's scheduler delays — and under load skips — runs in congested slots, and `:00` of every hour is the most congested of all; a skipped run of a freeze-detector is the same silent failure it exists to catch, one level up. The hour is pinned at **08:00 UTC**, a quiet window (US asleep, Europe just starting), so only the minute varies. Vary it per repo (don't reuse one favorite minute across a fleet), and don't ask the user — no one cares when a daily sweep runs, only that it does.

## Why

release-please can merge a release PR, report the run as **success**, and still create **no tag** — e.g. a title-pattern/component mismatch (see the config gotchas in `references/release-please.md`; [googleapis/release-please#2214](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please/issues/2214)). The run is green, nothing is tagged, and a stuck `autorelease: pending` PR then aborts *all* future releases silently. Watching the merge by hand doesn't reliably catch a tag that fails to appear a minute later; a machine check does.

## 1. `verify-tag` — appended to `release-please.yml`

These steps go on the **same** `release-please` job (reusing its runner — no extra job/spin-up). They need `id: release` on the release-please-action step and a checkout for the local composite. The complete `release-please.yml` (with these steps folded in) is in `references/release-please.md`; the verify-specific steps are:

```yaml
# verify-tag — final goal of the whole release setup: a merged release PR MUST
# produce a tag. Catches two failure modes:
#   1. the release-please step failed outright (loud), and
#   2. a release PR merged, the step reported success, but NO tag was created
#      (the silent freeze — a title-pattern/component mismatch; see the config
#      section of release-please.md).

Add `concurrency: { group: release-please, cancel-in-progress: false }` to `release-please.yml` too, so overlapping release runs serialize.

### ⚠️ Never read `steps.release.outputs.release_created` / `.tag_name` directly

Those unprefixed outputs exist **only when the manifest package sits at the repo root** (`"packages": { ".": … }`). `setPathOutput()` in release-please-action namespaces every per-package output for any other path:

```ts
if (path === '.') core.setOutput(key, value); // tag_name
else core.setOutput(`${path}--${key}`, value); // apps/web--tag_name
```

So in a repo whose package is `apps/web`, or any per-component monorepo (`backend`, `frontend` — both configs this skill scaffolds), both keys read back **empty** and a check built on them alerts "NO TAG created" on every single healthy release, forever. That is not hypothetical: it fired on a real 0.26.0 release that had tagged correctly, seconds after the tag was published in the same run.

Only `releases_created` (**plural**) and `paths_released` are top-level regardless of path, and neither carries a tag name — they're context in the alert body, not the signal. Hence `toJSON(steps.release.outputs)` + `endswith("tag_name")`: it finds the tag under whatever key the config produced, and the ref lookup on the remote is what actually decides pass/fail.

Related: `✔ No commits for path: <pkg>, skipping` in a release-merge run is **not** a failure signal — that's the *next* release PR having nothing to include, which is correct right after a release. Don't add an alert for it.

### ⚠️ The release-merge regex must tolerate a component in the title

`is_release_merge` is what arms the **silent-freeze** branch — the single most important check here. It matches the head commit's subject, and that subject is rendered from the config's `pull-request-title-pattern`, **not** fixed. A pattern carrying `${component}` produces a subject with the component name between "release" and the version:

```
chore(main): release  ingest-worker 0.7.0    # two spaces: ${component} renders with a leading space
chore(main): release 1.5.2                   # no component
```

A version-only pattern (`: release [0-9]`) silently fails to match the first form. `is_release_merge` stays `false`, the "merged but NO TAG created" branch becomes unreachable, and the repo gets a verification block that looks installed and cannot ever fire — the exact failure this whole file exists to prevent, reintroduced one level down. Note that this is **independent** of the namespaced-outputs trap above, and hits the same repos: a non-root package path is usually accompanied by `${component}` in the title pattern.

Hence the optional component group and the full `X.Y.Z` anchor:

```
^chore(\([^)]*\))?: release +([^ ]+ +)?v?[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+
```

Requiring all three version parts is what keeps the optional group from swallowing ordinary commits — `chore: release notes cleanup` must not match. Verified against real release commits in both shapes, plus non-release subjects.

        esac
```

## The webhook secret (optional — alerts no-op without it)

```bash
gh secret set <ALERT_WEBHOOK_SECRET> --repo <owner>/<repo>
```

Create the webhook on the channel the project's alerts should land in (Discord → Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → Copy Webhook URL) and paste it when prompted. The secret name is whatever was chosen above; the URL inside it is what selects the channel.

Unlike `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN`, this is **not** required — the composite skips the Discord push (with a warning) when the secret is absent, so the release pipeline still functions. Say so in the summary rather than blocking on it.

### The fallback when there's no webhook — alerts must not depend on it

**A webhook must never be the only channel.** It's an external service reached over the network with a credential that can be unset, revoked, or pointed at a deleted channel — so making it the sole path puts a single point of failure in front of the machinery whose entire job is catching failures. The tiers, in the templates above:

| Tier | Configured | Where the alert surfaces |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | nothing at all | `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` on the run page (full title + body) · `::warning::` / `::error::` annotation · **run goes red** → GitHub's own failure email |
| 1 | webhook secret | everything above, plus the Discord push |

Two rules that make tier 0 real, both of which were missing in the first version of these templates:

1. **Write `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` before the webhook call, unconditionally.** Not in the `else` branch. The summary is durable, renders as markdown on the run, needs no credential, and survives the webhook being wrong. Logging just the title on the no-webhook path (the original behaviour) throws away the part that says *what* is wrong.
2. **Any job whose finding is actionable must `exit 1`.** `pending-sweep` originally alerted and exited 0, so a stuck `autorelease: pending` PR — which blocks every future release — was found daily and discarded behind a green checkmark. A red run is the only notification that needs no setup whatsoever.

The corollary for the alert copy: the annotation should point at the summary rather than trying to cram the body into a single `::warning::` line, since annotations don't render multi-line markdown.

**But "optional" is exactly why it gets forgotten, and the failure mode is silence.** A repo with the workflows and no webhook looks identical to a healthy one: green runs, no alerts, and no alert is also what "nothing is wrong" looks like. Measured on one fleet, **only 1 of 13 repos** had the errors webhook set — every other repo had been no-opping its alerts since the day it was scaffolded, and nothing surfaced it. So:

- Put it in the **post-scaffold action list**, not just a summary line. Optional-but-forgotten is still broken.
- `ci-baseline-audit` check 10 catches this repo-wide after the fact — a workflow that references a secret the repo doesn't have. Scaffold-time is the cheap fix; the audit is the backstop.

### Prove it, don't assume it

Setting the secret is not evidence it works — a revoked webhook, a URL pasted from the wrong channel, or a truncated paste all store fine and fail silently later. GitHub secrets are write-only, so the only proof is delivery:

```bash
gh workflow run release-health.yml -R <owner>/<repo> --ref <default-branch> -f test_alert=true
```

Then confirm from the run log, **not** the run's conclusion — the job exits 0 either way, because a missing webhook is a deliberate no-op:

```bash
gh run view <run-id> -R <owner>/<repo> --log | grep -E 'alert delivered|skipping alert'
```

`alert delivered` only prints on a 2xx from Discord. `skipping alert` means the secret is empty. A green checkmark on its own tells you nothing.

## Activation timing (gitflow)

- `release-health.yml` runs on `schedule` / `workflow_dispatch`, which execute from the **default branch** — so it's live as soon as it lands on `develop`. Self-test it immediately: `gh workflow run release-health.yml -R <owner>/<repo> -f test_alert=true`.
- `verify-tag` lives in `release-please.yml` (`on: push: [main]`), so it **activates on the next develop→main promotion** and truly exercises on the next real release.

## Prettier note

The scaffolded `.prettierignore` (see `project-scaffold/references/configs/node-ts.md`) excludes `*.yml` / `*.yaml`, so prettier never touches workflow YAML and this is a non-issue for scaffolded repos. It only bites a repo that runs `prettier --check` over `.github` **without** that carve-out (`.github/**` isn't ignored by default) — there the emitted YAML must be prettier-clean or `format:check` fails on the scaffolding PR. These templates are formatted to prettier defaults (`printWidth: 100`, `tabWidth: 2`); if such a repo's `.prettierrc` differs, either add `*.yml`/`*.yaml` (or `.github/`) to its `.prettierignore` — the standard fix — or run `prettier --write` on the three emitted files before committing.

Separately, `CHANGELOG.md` and `.github/.release-please-manifest.json` must be in `.prettierignore` in every repo that runs `prettier --check .` — release-please rewrites both on every release PR and its output doesn't reliably satisfy prettier, so without the carve-out the release PR itself fails `format:check` and auto-merge freezes the release (see `release-please.md`, "Manifest — match current version").
