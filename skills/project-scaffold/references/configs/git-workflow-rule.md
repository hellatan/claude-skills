# Git workflow rule template (scaffolded into each new project)

This file is the **template content** that `project-scaffold` Step 10 writes to `.claude/rules/git-workflow.md` in the new project. It captures the workflow conventions the rest of the scaffold (protected branches, release-please, deploy on tag, etc.) assumes.

Write it verbatim. Replace `<PROJECT_NAME>` with the project name only if the template uses it (it currently doesn't).

# Git workflow

Conventions for this repo, intended for both humans and Claude sessions. The CI/CD pipeline, branch protection, and release flow all assume these rules — bypassing them risks accidental production deploys.

## Always work in an isolated branch

Never edit files directly on `develop` or `main`. Always create a feature branch first (or a git worktree, if you have multiple parallel changes).

Run `git branch --show-current` before every commit. If the result is `develop` or `main`, **stop** — uncommit nothing, but move the changes to a feature branch before committing.

## Branching

- Branch off `origin/develop`, never `main`. (Only branch off `main` for hotfixes against a tagged release.)
- If you're using git worktrees, the worktree branch must also be based on `origin/develop`. Either create it from `origin/develop` directly, or run `git fetch origin develop && git rebase origin/develop` after entering the worktree.

## Branch naming

- Feature work: `feature/<short-kebab-name>` on the remote.
- Bug fixes: `fix/<short-kebab-name>`.
- Chores / refactors / docs / CI: `chore/<short-kebab-name>`.
- Releases (release-please opens these for you): `release-please--…`.

If you use a personal local prefix (e.g., `worktree/<name>` for branches in a worktree), keep it different from the remote prefix so a worktree branch and its remote counterpart don't collide. See "Pushing" below for the refspec pattern.

## Pushing

- **Never push directly to `develop` or `main`.** Never force-push them under any circumstances.
- Always use an explicit refspec — don't push `HEAD`. The pattern is:
  ```bash
  git push -u origin <local-branch>:<remote-branch>
  ```
  Example: `git push -u origin worktree/dark-mode:feature/dark-mode`
- After the initial push, follow-up pushes from the same local branch go to the same remote branch automatically.

**Push gotcha:** `git checkout -b feature/x origin/develop` sets the new branch's upstream to `origin/develop`. A naive `git push -u origin feature/x` then pushes TO `develop`. Always use the explicit `local:remote` mapping to avoid this.

**Tag push gotcha:** Some setups have pre-push hooks that flag any push whose upstream tracks `main`/`develop` as a protected-branch push. To push a tag past such a hook, use the explicit tag refspec:
```bash
git push origin refs/tags/<tagname>:refs/tags/<tagname>
```

## Force-push exception: rebasing a stacked PR after its parent squash-merges

When PR A has been **squash-merged** into `develop` and PR B was originally branched off PR A's branch, PR B's history still contains PR A's pre-squash commits. Squash-merging PR B in that state risks GitHub computing a confusing diff. The fix is to rebase PR B onto `develop` and force-push.

**This specific force-push is allowed**:
1. Confirm PR A is squash-merged.
2. In PR B's branch / worktree: `git fetch origin develop && git reset --hard origin/develop`
3. `git cherry-pick <PR-B's-original-feature-commit>` — resolve any small conflicts to keep only PR B's additions.
4. `git push --force-with-lease origin <local>:<remote>`

Always `--force-with-lease`, never plain `--force`. Never force-push to `main`/`develop` regardless.

## Pull requests

- Open PRs against `develop` (the default branch). The PR can be **draft** until you want review.
- Let CI gate merges. The 5-check pipeline (lint+typecheck, format:check, unit, e2e, build) must be green.
- PR title should follow conventional-commit format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.) — release-please uses commit / PR titles to compute version bumps.
- PR body should include a "Summary" and a "Test plan" (checkbox list of how to verify the change).

## Release flow (driven by release-please)

1. Feature branches merge into `develop` via PR.
2. When ready to release: open a PR `develop` → `main`. CI runs the same 5 checks.
3. Merging `develop` → `main` triggers `release-please.yml`, which opens (or updates) a release PR against `main` with a generated `CHANGELOG.md` and version bump.
4. Merging the release PR tags the commit (e.g., `v1.2.0`) and creates a GitHub Release.
5. The tag push triggers `deploy.yml` for production deploy.

## Why these rules

`develop` is the protected integration branch — every change has to pass through CI before landing. `main` only gets release-please's release PRs. Pushing directly to either bypasses CI and can produce accidental deploys. The branch-protection rules in this repo enforce most of this, but the local conventions catch issues before you push.

## How this is used

`project-scaffold` Step 10 copies the **template content** (everything between the outer `````markdown` fences) verbatim to `<project-root>/.claude/rules/git-workflow.md` in the new project.

The CLAUDE.md template (in `claude-md-init`) references this file with `@.claude/rules/git-workflow.md`, so any Claude session working in the project picks it up automatically.

For retrofitting an existing repo with these rules: run `cp` of the template content directly, no skill needed — though `claude-md-init` could optionally do it if invoked with `--with-workflow-rule`.
